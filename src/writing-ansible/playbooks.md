You'll hear the word "Idempotent" a lot when talking about Ansible. This just the concept that doing the same operation twice will result in the same outcome. Which as you'd think is a good thing when automating things.

> \\( /ˌɪdɛmˈpəʊtnt,ˌʌɪdɛmˈpəʊtnt/ \\)
>
>> *adjective* \
>> denoting an element of a set which is unchanged in value when multiplied or otherwise operated on by itself.
